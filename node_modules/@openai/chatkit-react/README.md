# @openai/chatkit-react

React bindings for the ChatKit web component. Use this package when you want
hooks and JSX helpers that wrap `<openai-chatkit />`.

- Render the ChatKit widget with the `ChatKit` component
- Manage configuration and events with the `useChatKit` hook
- Keep parity with the vanilla JS API while staying inside React
